00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.640
Can whites increase our birth rates in the
absence of religion?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.490
What about a patriarchal society that respects
male reproductive rights?

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.280
Well, the very short answer to that is no,
you do need religion.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
And obviously, you need religion either because
religion is real,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.529
in some metaphysical sense, and necessary
to people's well-being and happiness,

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.310
Or (and this is not necessarily an incompatible
view), we are evolved towards devotion and

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.950
faith,
as a means of increasing the amount of binding

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.200
energy within a group,
thus increasing the efficiency of the group,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.820
in intergroup competition.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.180
So you always need religion.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.140
So far, nobody's really been able to come
up with a viable substitute for religion,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.649
as a source of organic cohesion within social
groups.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.570
So it seems that given human metaphysical
and genetic limitations,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.660
we very likely need religion,
and will continue to need religion going forwards

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.879
into the future.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.310
Yes, first of all, people that don't have
religion seem to have lower fertility,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.090
so they will die out.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.090
Secondly, people that don't have religion,
tend to have higher mental instability.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.380
I don't necessarily mean this is causal,
but they tend to have higher mental instability,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.930
higher depression, higher Autism.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.600
Thirdly, groups that don't have religion are
less ethnocentric,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.500
are less likely to fight for their own interests,
and will get selected out.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.670
As I said before, there is actually a specific
part of the brain called the anterior frontal

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.030
cortex,
which is associated both with religiousness

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.020
and ethnocentrism.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.000
And when you stimulate it with magnets, it
elevates both.
