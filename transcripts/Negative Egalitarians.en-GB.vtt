00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.900
I've been playing around with my own revision
to the haidt's scales, because I've thrown

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.460
out haidt's model, which I think is wrong.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.570
And I've rejiggered his items to make a better
version of his scale,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.000
where instead of measuring these stupid five
moral foundations,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.740
I found that really there's just two.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.570
And that the best way of getting at how they
actually collapse into the political left-right

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.560
continuum is to have a tilt.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.599
So you have individualizing, and binding moral
foundations,

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.320
and then you just compute the difference score
between them.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.640
And that gives you a left and a right.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.870
It's quite nice, actually, because people
high on binding tend to be high on group-oriented

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.070
behaviors.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.240
They tend to be high on religion, they tend
to be high on community orientation.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.500
Whereas people who are high on individualizing
also tend to be overly concerned with equality,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.010
and their own status relative to others.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.760
So really there's just this one dimension
there.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.190
And I've been finding that it correlates quite
strongly with measures of home brokenness,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.100
whether there's been experiences of violence
in the childhood environment.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.090
We've got correlations between individualizing
tilt, and having come from a home where the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.110
subject was exposed to violence as a child.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.409
So it looks like violence in the home may
begat leftist moral foundations through possibly

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.259
some epigenetic route.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.170
Well, you're saying that people who are leftist
are more likely to have experienced violence

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.170
in the home.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.910
Yes, that's right.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.610
It could also be that there are genetic correlations
there between genes that predispose one towards

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.550
dysfunctionality and violence,
and also genes that predispose one towards

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.479
being incredibly self rather than other focused,
as that seems to be characteristic of those

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.660
who score high on these individualizing moral
foundations.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.750
And we found a lot of the concern for equality
is not born out of an existential concern

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.240
for people.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.830
It's born out of a, where do I rank relative
to others, and how can I pull others down

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.920
towards me, and how can I level the playing
field in my favor?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.840
Gerhard Meisenberg has done a very interesting
book review of Superior by Angela Saini,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.010
in which he argues this is true of her, that
she is only interested in those who are in

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.750
her group.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.730
And you're only in her group if you're equal
to her.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.930
And if you're not equal to her, then you're
not in her group.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.800
So it's the ultimate selfishness.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
Yeah, the big idea I've been trying to tie
my head around, which is based on the idea

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.730
that it doesn't make sense initially
to think of people who are highly individualistic,

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.480
as being also high on equality preferences.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.050
But when you think about it in this way, it
makes a lot of sense.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.489
Moreover, it leads one to the conclusion that
there exists a form of positive and negative

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.650
egalitarianism.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.890
Just as there are positive and negative forms
of ethnocentrism and misogyny, there are also

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.150
positive and negative forms of egalitarianism.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.140
And the egalitarianism which is based on leveling
and elimination of differences in order to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.349
raise comparative advantage,
would be a negative specie of egalitarianism.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.200
Whereas the egalitarianism where you're concerned
about the overall condition of the poor,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.950
and you believe that there's some role for
charity in ameliorating the hardships, of

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.959
what the Victorian era referred to as the
deserving poor.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.420
Or conversely, you are someone who is very
concerned with the possibility of people becoming

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.980
so wealthy,
that in so doing, they start to damage the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.540
interests of their corporate polity.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.599
That form of egalitarianism, which is not
a leftist egalitarianism,

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.379
it's more of a kind of rightist egalitarianism,
because it often gels with traditional notions

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.700
of how societies should be structured,
and put together and limited.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.810
If you look at distributism as a model of
economics, for example, and the social teachings

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.879
of the Catholic Church in the 20s and 30s
and things,

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.260
you can see lots of evidence of this positive
egalitarianism, where it's born out of a real

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.810
concern for how excessive inequality
can damage the corporate well-being.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.030
Sorry, these negative egalitarians, they want
to suppress the evidence of the existence

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.699
of differences between groups of people.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.680
Well, they don't want to suppress evidence
of the existence of differences, they're happy

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.320
to accept that there are differences.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.600
It's the etiology of the differences.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.690
They don't want any talk about the differences
being caused by genetics.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.729
They're very happy to talk about the differences
being caused by oppression.

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.030
So they get very uncomfortable if you point
out that socioeconomic status and IQ are genetically

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.560
correlated,
and actually share variance through a common

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.490
set of apparently causal variance.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.250
They don't like you using polygenic scores
for IQ to predict differences in educational

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.180
attainment and socioeconomic status.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.130
Why do you think that's the case?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.550
It's a very interesting question.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.360
I have to think about it some more.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.160
This is something I want to get at through
scale construction.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.380
I actually want to try and build a scale and
instrument that I can validate,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.830
that can measure and differentiate between
these two types of egalitarianism,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.520
just as there are scales for positive and
negative ethnocentrism, which have already

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.479
been validated,
I would like to build a similar one for egalitarianism.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.389
But as to why that might be the case, maybe
these people who are high on negative egalitarianism

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:45.600
(as Darwin says) bear the indelible stamp
of their lowly origins.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.759
And they don't want to think any aspect of
their past, or any aspect of their immediate

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.050
familial history is an impediment to their
perceived actual social success.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.289
It struck me as consistent with what you were
saying about left-wing people having had more

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.860
violent childhoods.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.139
And they, on some sort of cognitive dissonance
level, realize that nature is red in tooth

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.009
and claw,
and they are a product of that.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.580
That's what's made them who they are,
these big genetic indelible differences.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.240
And they just can't deal with knowing that.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.130
Well, actually a colleague of mine who's been
teaching for a very, very long period of time,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.570
he has noted anecdotally that those who are
the most resistant to behavior genetic perspectives,

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.979
are typically those who self-identify as having
come from a background of dysfunctionality.

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.840
And they don't want to think that their background,
in terms of their familial background and

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.780
the generally dysfunctional context from which
they arose,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.940
could play any kind of a role in making them
who they are.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.840
They want to believe in a super free will.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.699
They want your person and your process of
self-actualization

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.729
to be completely decoupled from genetic constraints.

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.629
And they want this process of personal evolution,
essentially, to be

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.440
entirely independent of anything that could
hold them back.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.300
Our character is entirely in our own hands.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.460
Don't forget that, my baby.
