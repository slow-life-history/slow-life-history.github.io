00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.280
He asks: You talk about infusing&nbsp;
intelligent people with religion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.240
could you elaborate a bit on this?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.880
what I pointed out is that historically&nbsp;
if you look at the great geniuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.280
of the 19th century, one thing they seem
to have in common is religious faith. A lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.080
these people were not atheists. They were not just
religious, they believed that scientific research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.560
was a form of revelation,&nbsp;
they called it neo-tomism.&nbsp;

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.720
So the idea is that engaging in scientific work,&nbsp;
discovering truth, placing a premium on truth,&nbsp;

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.680
this was all divinely ordained&nbsp;
essentially. And this was a motive&nbsp;

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.800
complex which kept them very truthful, kept&nbsp;
them very dedicated, kept them aligned with&nbsp;

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.280
objective truth. It also allowed&nbsp;
them to move into areas which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.320
were socially taboo, fully cognizant of
the fact that in so doing, they were doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.200
god's work. This was an act of revelation
and if things had to change,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.720
if this finding challenged some&nbsp;
preconceived notion, then so be it,&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.440
to do otherwise to suppress that was bad. And&nbsp;
this was a very powerful way of protecting&nbsp;

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.760
yourself against heterodoxy, and also imbuing&nbsp;
your life with a existential purpose, a life of&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.240
purposefulness, and a drive towards scientific&nbsp;
inquiry. So if you could put that back into&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.040
modern scientists, and charles murray (who was the&nbsp;
first to propose this thesis in a book published&nbsp;

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.000
in 2003 called human&nbsp;
accomplishment). He argues that&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.960
one of the transitions that's&nbsp;
taken place is that these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.640
religious values have basically gone, they've
evaporated. And they've been replaced with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.720
freudian freudo-marxist nihilist relativist type
values systems instead, which do not place a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.080
premium on truth, and see truth as being something
that's expedient, and plays into power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.600
dynamics. And on that basis, Murray
argues that this has handicapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.440
the innovativeness of scientists&nbsp;
because they're not able to pursue&nbsp;

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.680
truth, that they don't existentially value it,&nbsp;
they don't place a premium on it. And if they&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.480
substitute truth for politically&nbsp;
expedient lies, and there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.240
many instances of scientific research
where politically expedient lies dominate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.840
then they do anti-truth. They're coming to
conclusions which are in opposition to truth, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.040
that handicaps science even further. And that was
Murray's theory. So one possibility is, yes, by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.040
making scientists more religious, by making them
more godly or spiritual, maybe you could actually&nbsp;

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.760
make them better scientists, in the same&nbsp;
way that the Victorians polymathic geniuses,&nbsp;

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.360
who were all deeply devoutly religious&nbsp;
and Thomistic, were very good scientists.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.320
Yes, something I've been thinking&nbsp;
about a lot recently, is the&nbsp;

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.880
exclusion of us in academia, and the data&nbsp;
sets we can't get hold of. But the Victorian&nbsp;

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.680
University, until about 1871, when they tried to&nbsp;
change it, didn't really do that much in the way&nbsp;

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.600
of research. Research was&nbsp;
done by gentlemen scholars,&nbsp;

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.960
by interested working-class&nbsp;
amateurs like Thomas Edward the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.280
Aberdeen Shoemaker, by people with
patrons, and by scholar-rectors...

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.120
Michael Faraday for example.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.720
Exactly. There wasn't much in the way of&nbsp;
actual people doing research at universities,&nbsp;

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.360
because the university was just basically in the&nbsp;
hands of the church, and it was about educating&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400
vicars and lawyers, and to a lesser extent,&nbsp;
doctors. But it was really about promoting the&nbsp;

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.680
ideology of society, and that was basically&nbsp;
religion and monarchy. And it was only&nbsp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.240
in 1871 that they got rid of a&nbsp;
system where in order to be a fellow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.080
in order to work at the university,
you had to be ordained to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.840
You had prep school headmasters that would do&nbsp;
research, and public school headmasters that&nbsp;

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.120
would do research. There wasn't anything going&nbsp;
on at the universities. And I think that in some&nbsp;

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.720
respects, we're going to move back&nbsp;
to that. We are moving back to that.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.360
I hope so. It would certainly&nbsp;
be a more convivial arrangement.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.800
With certain areas of research, the&nbsp;
university has become, to a certain extent&nbsp;

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.920
(particularly in social science and humanities) a&nbsp;
body whose purpose is to promote what used to be&nbsp;

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.120
Christianity, and now it's the&nbsp;
religion of multiculturalism.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.480
Mercier Eliade looked at this, that left-wing&nbsp;
ideologies have some significant points of&nbsp;

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.480
commonality with Christianity in&nbsp;
a lot of ways, the guilt and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.840
shame and all this sort of thing,
and the worshipping of those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.520
are perceived as disempowered and all&nbsp;
this, the anti-Nietzschean system...

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.840
That would be Victimhood morality, the idea&nbsp;
that your nobility is in your Victimhood.
