00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.439
What is your opinion on Nietzsche's rejection
of Christianity?

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.260
That it glorifies suffering and victimhood,
how can it defend against a

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.010
conquering religion like Islam?

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.320
well, it has defended against Islam
in the past.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.330
At the gates of Vienna,
it defended against Islam.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.930
it seems to me that the
religion will be interpreted

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.260
in an adaptive way,
if you're under high levels of group selection.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.929
the religion the society
has adopted will be interpreted in an adaptive

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.500
way, the adaptive bits will be drawn
out.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.700
when it began, it was
an attempt perhaps you could argue like

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.399
multiculturalism or cosmopolitanism, it was
an attempt

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.789
for people who were in the middle of society
to gain status by virtue signaling.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.260
It wasn't an attempt
to be a religion of an entire group.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.210
it was an attempt for people within a
group to attain status, by

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.800
the way that the middle class always does,
by intellectual posing

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.739
and virtue signaling.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.730
It did that, and became the religion
of the empire.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.769
Fortunately
there was a large corpus of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.860
texts involved, and it was open to all
kinds of interpretation.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.650
And so it was
interpreted in a positive way.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.939
Really the Jewish bits
were stressed.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.640
We became the heirs of
Jewish ideas about

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.740
ethnocentrism, and being the chosen
people, and therefore

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.659
it became an adaptive thing.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.450
now as we become maladaptive,
and the church becomes infested with

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.720
mutants, then you start to see
it becoming a force

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.979
of destruction.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.920
I don't think
there's anything inherent in Christianity

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.630
that's maladaptive.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.270
equally when Islam started
you can find bits in Islam which are

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.159
like that, and which are maladaptive,
which are the religion of the middle people,

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.119
that are
striving up and overthrowing

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.119
Mecca.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.020
And then as
Muhammad builds up an empire, then the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.240
nature of what Allah is telling him to say
starts to change, and it becomes more

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.510
adaptive as a group organization.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.259
even within Hinduism
and other pagan religions you can find

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.259
these discourses.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.690
so I don't think there's anything inherent
in Christianity

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.930
that's a problem.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.040
it's inherent in the kind
of people that practice Christianity.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.170
Those people are increasingly mutated
and increasingly kind of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.830
multiculturalist and a mitre.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.400
Yes, I'd agree.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.550
I've
become very interested in Christianity of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.550
late.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.680
I don't see anything intrinsic
in Christianity that lends itself to these,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.300
shall we say Episcopalian
interpretations, or corruptions

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.680
depending on your frame of reference.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.930
the problem is not with the religion
it's with the people who are

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.629
contemporary practitioners of the religion,
who wish to use the religion as a

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.129
vehicle to promote their
moral and social agenda, which is

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.590
often deeply
at variance, with

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.890
the actual religious teachings
contained in the Bible.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.290
Actually, a very good example of this is
the head of the Episcopal Church in America,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.590
who's a woman.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.819
she stood up, and argued
that Peter was having his privilege checked,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.959
when he drove a demon out of a young lady,
who was enthralled to some demon

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.650
in in this biblical parable,
that he was actually jealous of her freedom,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.049
and he realized the error of his ways.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.269
If you read the actual parable it's
completely the opposite, it's nothing to do

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.660
with that.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.049
it's about him
saving people from a very bad situation, which

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.400
had arisen involving
somebody being taken over by a demon.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.930
it's very interesting
that a epistatic mutant like that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.780
takes the side of the demon.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.670
She was saying that Peter was wrong
to have carried out his duty to God,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.140
which is what the Bible makes very clear he
was doing.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.640
She's basically a witch.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.460
The American Episcopal Church is run by a
woman,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.459
who acts like she has a pact with Satan.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.099
And thinks that women who have been possessed
by Satan i.e. women who are witches,

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.710
should be left alone, by godly people.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.019
and those godly people only want to expel
Satan from them

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.450
because they're sexist.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.880
There's a very special and warm place reserved
for that woman after death,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.460
with the demons that she so adores.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.250
In summary, given the church's embrace of
female preaching and homosexuality,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.350
despite the strictest condemnations of it
in the bible,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.289
you would be totally conceited to think
your ideal Pagan religion would not be just

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.540
as compromised and corrupted,
by chronic individual level selection, as

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.870
Christianity is today.
