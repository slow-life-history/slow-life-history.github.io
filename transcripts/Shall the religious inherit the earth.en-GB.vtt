00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.860
Will very religious christians outbreed the
atheists? What are the projections

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:12.049
for amish, mormons, catholics in anno domini
2100. I don't know the projections but it's

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.019
almost
certain that christians are going to outbreed

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.710
atheists because the fertility differentials
are absolutely massive. For any religious

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.330
individual of any denomination religiosity
seems

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.710
to have these very pronounced natalistic effects.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.500
We have another question, what is our view
on eric kaufman's work? so it fits completely

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.809
with the
previous question. So Eric kaufman has a book

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.940
Shall the religious
inherit the earth. A few years ago there was

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.070
a paper by helmet nyborg and lee ellis,
who showed comprehensively with a large data

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.590
set that absolutely
the religious will inherit the earth.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.090
They will. i mean it's impossible for them
not to, they have so many more children than

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.820
the
non-religious than the atheists.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.070
Also don't forget gerhard meisenberg, underappreciated.
He put out a paper in which he also produced

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.369
these projections showing religiosity
growing as a function of fertility differentials

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.970
using the world values survey. Everyone overlooks
that paper.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.590
I see it like this: that that our stress levels
go down because of the industrial revolution

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.829
and this
makes us less religious, since religiousness

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.259
is associated with stress.
so the more stressed you are, the more religious

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.479
you become. And so the society has become
less religious gradually. But while that's

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.049
happening, while we are becoming less religious
at the environmental level, we are becoming

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.659
more religious at the genetic level due to
differential fertility. And eventually it

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.689
reaches a point where the differential
is such that that religiousness pokes through,

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.439
and we start to become more religious even
though stress levels are still bottomed out.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.039
And then what will probably happen is the
stress levels will go up

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:04.950
because religiousness is associated with ethnocentrism,
so it could elevate (perhaps) ethnic conflict.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.209
The differential breeding of
religious muslims is very high, it's like

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.220
five kids. So I would suspect that we can
expect

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.270
religious future, which is exactly what Eric
Kaufmann predicts in his book.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.830
One of the problems is that christianity has
been so debased (despite christians breeding

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.390
more than than
atheists), christianity has been so humiliated,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.390
hasn't it?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.690
Yes, the vitality and vigor of any given religion,
is going to be a function of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.629
the degree to which it is embedded within
a society that is undergoing very very strong

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.519
group selection.
Because don't forget religion is an adaptation

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.710
to group selection, this was D S Wilson's
argument

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.611
he put forward in darwin's cathedral. That
it solves the free-riding problem, that it

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.780
makes a virtue out
of ethnocentrism, martyrdom, self-sacrifice,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.190
and it provides people with
monumentalist meaning in their lives, such

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.239
that they are happy toiling because they know
ultimately there is a greater good being served

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.770
in so doing,
reflected through the success of your nation,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.500
which is in turn a reflection on the glory
of your God.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.830
And if a society is falling apart through
a regime of chronic, persistent, individual-level

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.430
selection,
as we are living through at the moment, the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.590
religious institutions will change to adapt
to that reality.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.300
They will become pushers of whatever fashionable
bromides are going.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.610
They will drop all of the group-selected trappings
of the religion, retreat from their basic

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.580
function, essentially.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.760
It's not those types of religious people that
are breeding heavily.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.239
Yes, that's right. It's people who are more
old-style, old-book type.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.730
This is the kind of religion we were selected
for. Religion is 40% genetic, it has a fertility

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.720
advantage as well.
And so this implies it's something that's

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.250
been selected for in itself, rather than simply
a bundle of things that have been selected

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.870
for that come together as religion.
The paper The Mutant Says in His Heart There

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.840
Is No God, claims that we were selected for
this very specific form of religiosity,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.459
for a moral God whom we worship collectively.
And it seems that deviations from that is

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.940
associated with low fertility, and holding
to that associated with high fertility.
