00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.400
He asks is there a extraversion&nbsp;
and IQ correlation?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.240
Yes, we have new data on this.
This is very interesting,&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.880
extraversion and IQ are slightly negatively&nbsp;
correlated, based on a massive meta analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.640
that hasn't been published yet.
I'd love it if the authors would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840
go ahead and publish it.
It was a master's thesis.&nbsp;

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.280
But, yes, they found very&nbsp;
slight negative correlations,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.360
I downloaded the thesis because it's&nbsp;
relevant to a broader interest of mine,&nbsp;

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.960
of what traits are going to get promoted&nbsp;
under a regime of artificial selection (i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.680
designer babies), where people get to
choose what their offspring are like.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.400
So basically, what you're saying is&nbsp;
that if people choose their offspring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.520
they will choose very weakly stupidity.&nbsp;

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.080
Oh, women overwhelmingly want&nbsp;
highly extroverted offspring.&nbsp;

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.360
They do not want highly intelligent offspring.
So in terms of the genetic correlation between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.320
those traits, that will make&nbsp;
it negative very quickly.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.320
Is it a genetic correlation?
Yes, that's a standing prediction I have.&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.480
Why?
Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.160
one of the reasons for the correlation, is recent&nbsp;
patterns of directional selection, a very intense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.520
directional selection, which has been operating&nbsp;
on these populations for the last 200 years.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.080
We need to tease apart the variance components,
and the problem with the correlation between IQ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.680
and extraversion, is it's rather small.
So you need a very, very large sample,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.960
to really get at the shared&nbsp;
genetic variance among components,&nbsp;

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.320
which are largely independent of one another.
And you can do power calculations to work out&nbsp;

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.120
exactly how many twins you&nbsp;
would need to throw at this.&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.960
But there might be a simpler way of doing it.
I actually have two data sets, some very good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.680
ones, in which there are polygenic scores for IQ,
and also phenotypic data on some of the big five.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.720
So if extraversion is in there, you&nbsp;
could do a really interesting study,&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.200
to see if you can use the polygenic scores for IQ,&nbsp;

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.120
to mediate any, phenotypic associations between IQ&nbsp;
and extraversion, that we find in those data sets.&nbsp;

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.920
Then we don't need the twins.
And we can also increase the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.560
power to detect the effect, as the sample size&nbsp;
is like 10,000 each for both of the studies.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.200
I was wondering about some research, I found,&nbsp;
which said that extraversion is part of the GFP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.240
the general factor of personality,&nbsp;
which for people that aren't familiar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.240
this is a measure of social effectiveness (high&nbsp;
GFP people expend more effort essentially).&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.600
However, part of the GFP is extraversion.
But I understand that extraversion is weakly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.360
associated with short term sexual relationships,&nbsp;
which has an inverse relationship with the GFP.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.280
Well, they would be related&nbsp;
only insofar as extraversion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.760
is related to venturesomeness and dominance.
So this is one of Kevin McDonald's ideas from way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.200
back, when he was still a personality psychologist&nbsp;
studying the evolution of personality.&nbsp;

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.160
He had this idea that the big five in humans,&nbsp;
should be made to look more like the big five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160
in chimps, because there's a different&nbsp;
big five in chimpanzees and gorillas.&nbsp;

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.720
Instead of an extraversion&nbsp;
and an agreeableness factor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.760
they have a dominance factor, which&nbsp;
captures dominance and venturesomeness.&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.000
And they have a warmth and affiliative&nbsp;
factor, instead of an agreeableness factor.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.560
So what Kevin argued is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.600
we should tweak the factor structures&nbsp;
by imposing these oblamin rotations,&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.520
in order to recover these more&nbsp;
evolutionarily informed big five.&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.200
So you still have the big five,
it's just you forced certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.320
things to become dominance, and you forced&nbsp;
certain things to become agreeableness,&nbsp;

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.880
and in doing so, you've made them&nbsp;
into slightly different things,&nbsp;

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.520
which align a bit more with&nbsp;
what we notice in primates.&nbsp;

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.920
So it would be interesting to see what happens&nbsp;
to the GFP, when you do those rotations.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.240
Does this flip the sign of the association&nbsp;
between extraversion and the GFP?&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.680
My longstanding prediction is, yes, it should do.
It should actually make the association&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.880
with the GFP negative,
because now instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.200
getting all the gregariousness in the extraversion&nbsp;
factor, you're now forcing it into agreeableness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.560
as part of this affiliative factor.
So all the gregariousness that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.920
ordinarily rate you as high extraversion, because&nbsp;
you'd like going out and interacting with people,&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.680
but you don't necessarily like&nbsp;
dominating them, trying to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.360
control. You're not highly directive, to&nbsp;
use John Jay Ray's old term for his scale,&nbsp;

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.680
from the 1970s, on authoritarian behavior,&nbsp;
which he called the directiveness measure.&nbsp;

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.920
The best measure of authoritarian responding we&nbsp;
have, by the way, is Ray's directiveness scale.&nbsp;

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.760
So in other words, you're getting&nbsp;
a directiveness scale, and you're&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760
putting that directiveness scale possibly&nbsp;
in negative conjunction with the GFP.&nbsp;

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.680
It'd be very interesting to see what&nbsp;
that does to the factor structure.
