00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.040
how might the international relocation of
species

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.319
affect the future environment of selection?

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.440
for example
sweet corn in europe, european diaspora, no

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.760
wolves in Britain, a zoo animal escapes internationally?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.779
I can give you a very good answer to that
question.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.810
A group at the university of arizona are working
on a theory

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.420
called the portmanteau traveling biota theory.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.990
The portmanteau traveling biota theory
is based on the idea that humans and their

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.230
domesticates exerted a reciprocal
influence on one another's evolution.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.489
And that when different populations of humans
spread to different parts of the world, it's

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.289
not just this
bunch of people

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.810
moving over to this other part of the world,
they bring with them their portmanteau biota.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.280
that means their diseases, that means their
domesticates their cultivars, their crops,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.329
their pests and vermin.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.310
all of that travels with them.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.690
and it's interesting because there are strong
coevolutionary pressures, which have arisen

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.210
in the course of human evolution from domesticates.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.610
a good example would be lactate persistence,
and its spread.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.400
it's obvious that if you can metabolize lactose
you can break that down,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.310
and use it as a dietary sugar, you can liberate
huge numbers of calories, for very little

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.040
effort.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.909
all you need to do is have dairy.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.740
so it's not a surprise that lactose persistence
spread

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.150
concomitantly with dairying culture, with
the spread of cows.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.560
so where you get one, you get the
other.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.009
this is one of the earliest examples of
an unambiguous culture gene co-evolution.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.729
but don't forget we also did
things to cows which affected their evolution.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.159
so domestication
was very much a two-way street, the same is

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.530
true of crops.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.770
All this nonsense people have about
they can't digest this that and the other

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.040
substance, like gluten.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.631
well it turns out that yes, some people
can digest it, other people have a

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:06.450
harder time digesting it.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.720
Gluten sufficiency might actually relate to
a history

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.360
of how we co-evolve with respect to certain
domesticates, some of which may have

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.819
produced foodstuffs that were very rich in
gluten, like wheat.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.290
so it's clear that there is this tremendous
coevolutionary pressure.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.090
that humans have all not just in isolation,
they evolve in relation to their surrounding

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.379
ecology, and they've exerted reciprocal effects
on the composition of that ecology. and the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.069
way they influence the selective
pressures acting on specific species, through

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.400
artificial selection,
in turn influenced the sets of relationships

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.690
that existed between those species and other
species which meant you could

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.980
have these massive impacts on the surrounding
ecology, as a consequence of the action of

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.040
human
domestication pressures.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.770
so it's a hugely important question, and it's
one for which data is being gathered, in terms

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.159
of being able to comprehensively test this
portmanteau biota model.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.170
and actually there's a
very good paper published in the journal evolutionary

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.209
psychological sciences.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.860
it's called plants parasites and people.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.760
and they look at this very mysterious association
which seems to exist between the presence

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.170
of coniferous plants, and perennial
plants, which are present in more northerly

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.440
latitudes, and parasite burden, and k selection
in

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440
humans.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.310
and what they found is that the presence of
evergreen plants, verse perennial plants which

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.980
drop their leaves onto
the ground once a year, like oak, woody dicots.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.879
the presence of these strongly mediates the
association between the prevalence of parasites

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.030
in the environment, and your level of life
history

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.920
speed, so how slow your life history is.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.530
and it turns out that the reason the plants
mediate this

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.390
association is because what's happening is
the plants are engaging in chemical warfare

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.900
against
parasites in the soil, pushing the numbers

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.360
of those parasites down, which in turn releases
humans from

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.019
a major source of r selection, i-e disease
outbreaks that cause unpredictable mortality

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.490
and morbidity,
which is the major factor selecting fast life

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.500
history.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.750
so where you have
all these plants you have a strong coevolutionary

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.990
pressure.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.139
the plants are doing something
for humans, which means the humans are more

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.800
likely to do things that are going to encourage
the growth

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.140
of these plants.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.010
so that's a good example of this reciprocal
effect, which is mediated through the effect

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.009
of a plant on parasites, and the downstream
effect that that's had on human

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.540
adaptive landscape in these regions.
