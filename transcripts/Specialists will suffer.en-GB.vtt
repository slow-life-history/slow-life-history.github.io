00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.100
He asks: when society collapses, will we see
a greater die out of intelligent people,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.830
since they've been out of darwinian selection
for longer, and therefore have more mutations.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.639
And also the fact that they live more in cities?

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.530
well, it's interesting.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.630
I've always wondered, it's not so much the
high IQ types, it's the high

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.630
specialists.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
So it's those individuals who have become
extremely specialized,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.350
the K strategists.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.769
They're the ones who are going to suffer in
the event of a large-scale

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.390
civilizational declension event.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.579
So where the civilization just shifts into
a lower state of development,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.790
or literally collapses at the core, it transitions
from say urbanization to agriculture,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.760
just like that due to the mother of all economic
contractions-

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.059
And we end up like north korea.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.920
If you read descriptions of the famine in
the 90s, it was people like teachers and doctors,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.790
they just couldn't make any money, they worked
for the state but weren't being paid, and

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.219
they died.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.740
And it was people that had broader set of
skills, such that they could let's say produce

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.350
food and sell it
where more likely to survive.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.500
you're shifting the
selection pressure from specialists to generalists

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.470
essentially, and insofar as high IQ people
might be

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.680
somewhat more likely to be specialists, they
will die out to a greater extent.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.460
So it will select for more intelligent R strategists,
I suppose.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.360
It would do in theory.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.120
So people (leaders) who can organize
production, who are highly generalized, and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.150
who are
very very good at being able to quickly adapt.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.299
People who are very good obligate generalists,
that is people very good at being able to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.630
move around unstable niches, and they can
always get

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.570
the group to a position in the niche where
it's going to be able to profit.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.750
And these
people might be a bit exploitative, and a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590
bit crude, and a bit psychopathic.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.509
So it might be those people who end up flourishing
in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.830
leadership roles in that civilizational context.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.430
So yeah that's a very good
question, it'd be a good basis I think for

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.400
a science fiction book actually, if someone
was

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.610
inclined in a literary way to try and imagine
what the world would be like in say the star

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.290
trek date, 22 65.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.590
Write a novel about 2265, the serious version
of idiocracy.
