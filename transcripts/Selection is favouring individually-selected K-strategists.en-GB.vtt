00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.000
He asks: who has higher
fertility the group or individually selected

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.940
people in the uk and usa?

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.389
Well, based on a swedish study it's k strategy
that predicts fertility (in sweden at least,

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.500
and probably in the
uk and the usa too).

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.420
Since k strategy is associated with group
selectedness, I imagine it's something closer

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.260
to group selection
which predicts fertility.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
And it's R strategy which is much more
individualistic, which predicts low fertility,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.779
so we would say it's people that are more
group selected that are breeding, on that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.910
indicator.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.010
i don't think so.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.340
I think that the
high k strategy morph, that is being selected

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.180
for, is actually particularly individually
selected.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.110
what about the religiousness predicting fertility,
and they're group selected aren't they?

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.270
well actually, I've had a long discussion
on this, and the conclusion my colleagues

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.140
and i have come
to is that life history strategy particularly

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.710
among the high k end
is branchy, and people with slow life

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.220
histories are differentiated
behaviorally.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.629
So there might be some morphs which are group
selected, and there are likely morphs

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.510
which are highly individually selected, and
it's likely you also get a mixture of both.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.390
But i
suspect the ones (and this obviously is something

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.910
that needs to be tested), my suspicion is
that the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.210
ones who are undergoing the fertility boom
at the moment, are the ones who are probably

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.710
highly individually selected.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.970
And these would be ones who are adapted to
fitting into societal micro niches, and conforming

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.760
to structures around them.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.369
This is among the K strategists, you're talking
about.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.960
Yes, this would be among people with slow
life histories.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.710
I don't think they're particularly group selected.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.000
But what about the fact that religiousness
predicts fertility?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.329
Well, I don't know if the religiousness that
people profess today is particularly group

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.329
selected.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.140
I mean have you heard any particularly fiery
group selected Anglican sermons of late?

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.810
But that's not... they're nothing, they're
dying out.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.479
Yes, but they're the mainline religion in
Britain.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.119
And then you have protestants who are not
much better, who are the mainline religion

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.850
virtually everywhere else in the West.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.670
The less said about the Catholics, the better
at this stage.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.940
They're a mutated religion.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.180
But the ones that are breeding above replacement
fertility, if you've got the Muslims, the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.180
Mormons.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.360
Ah, you're talking...

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.620
So I thought we're talking about just Europeans.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.670
Right.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.860
If you extend this to between group comparisons,
yes, I think you're looking at very strong

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.130
selection for group selected traits among
non-European people,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.840
especially non-European people who are sharing
nations with European people.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.490
But also the Mormons are doing well, and the
Amish because they have preserved a pre-industrial

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.459
lifestyle to some extent.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.580
The Amish have very high rates of infant mortality.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.580
Do you know that?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.470
Well good, that means they're under purifying
selection.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.550
Over 20 percent infant mortality based on
some estimates from the 70s.
