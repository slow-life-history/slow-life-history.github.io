00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.520
what is the evolutionary reason for gray hair?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.590
Does it serve to signal anything?

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.600
Well, it actually happens I've been doing
some amateur, ad hoc research on the grayness

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.610
of beards.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.599
I think hair color is like an honest signal
of youth.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.279
so what happens is you accumulate somatic
mutations, and that's what seems to cause

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.430
hair to
go gray.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.690
And the older you get, the more somatic mutations
you accumulate in your hair follicles.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.169
So if you have good anti-aging mechanisms,
at your disposal like a good DNA repair,

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.800
protective factors, then you can stay brown,
or whatever your natural hair

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.230
color is, for longer.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.010
And of course, if you have lower quality DNA
repair mechanisms, then

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.219
you'll get gray earlier.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.570
So it's usually in the 30s for men, when they
start to get their

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.609
first couple of gray hairs, and then they
kind of just flip in their 40s.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.910
But I do know some guys in their
40s who were really not gray at all.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.760
So my father's in his 70s, yet he has no gray
hair at all! he's the same color as his 30s.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.331
I've got this theory about beards.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:11.470
Beards are very evolutionary interesting,
because beards go gray earlier than hair on

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.970
the head.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.680
And I've seen people walking around in their
late 30s, with gray beards but normal coloured

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
hair.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.060
And one possibility is that the beard is a
costly signal in men.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.290
Not only does it artificially increase the
apparent age,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.330
beyond their actual age (there is a cost to
having it, it's like an anti-neoteny signal),

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.600
but also it can honestly signal youth by virtue
of it's colour.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.970
and if it can stay brown for a long period
of time, longer than it should do,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.249
then it indicates good genes for neoteny.
